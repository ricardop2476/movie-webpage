    <p>Do you dream? Whenever Mark dreams, he is able to “go back in time”. In these situations, he finds himself in different time periods where he is able to interact with the environment. In each of his episodes he sees how the world was before his time and learns from his experiences. This seems interesting and cool, right? There are some issues with Mark’s power. For every dream that he has, he has to solve an issue. This can be by helping people or solving issues. He can not wake up until he has achieved his goal. What trouble will Mark run into? How will he solve issues? Will he find himself trapped in his dream forever? Find out soon!
